If DRCC determines you need to slow down more, an audio and visual alert notifies you and brakes may be applied. When there’s no longer a vehicle driving slower than your preset speed in front of you, DRCC will then accelerate to the preset speed and regular cruise control will resume.

If the system determines that a frontal collision is likely, it prompts you to take action using audio and visual alerts. If you notice the potential collision and apply the brakes, PCS w/PD may apply additional force using Brake Assist.  If you don’t brake in time, it may automatically apply the brakes to reduce your speed, helping to minimize the likelihood of a frontal collision or reduce its severity.

2019,Toyota,HIGHLANDER HYBRID,Toyota Safety Sense™ P (TSS-P),Dynamic Radar Cruise Control,"Intended for highways and similar to “constant speed” cruise control, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)  lets you drive at a preset speed. DRCC uses vehicle-to-vehicle distance control, which adjusts your speed, to help you maintain a preset distance from vehicles ahead of you that are driving at a slower speed. DRCC uses a front-grille-mounted radar and an in-vehicle camera designed to detect vehicles and their distance. If a driver is traveling slower than you, or within your preset range, DRCC will automatically slow your vehicle down without deactivating cruise control. If DRCC determines you need to slow down more, an audio and visual alert notifies you and brakes are applied. When there’s no longer a vehicle driving slower than your set speed in front of you, DRCC will then accelerate to the preset speed.

In addition, Toyota vehicles equipped with Toyota Safety Sense™ P (TSS-P)  and Electronic Power Steering (EPS) include Steering Assist  functionality.

2020,Toyota,PRIUS,TSS-P,Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control,"Intended for highway use and similar to “constant speed” cruise control, available Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)  lets you drive at a preset speed. DRCC uses vehicle-to-vehicle distance control, which is designed to adjust your speed, to help you maintain a preset distance from the vehicle ahead of you that is driving at a slower speed. DRCC uses a front-grille-mounted radar and an in-vehicle camera designed to detect vehicles and their distance. If a driver is traveling slower than you, or within your preset range, DRCC is designed to automatically slow your vehicle down without deactivating cruise control. If DRCC determines you need to slow down more, an audio and visual alert notifies you and brakes may be applied. When there’s no longer a vehicle driving slower than your preset speed in front of you, DRCC will then accelerate to the preset speed and regular cruise control will resume.

2019,Toyota,COROLLA,Standard Toyota Safety Sense™ P (TSS-P),Standard Dynamic Radar Cruise Control,"Intended for highways and similar to “constant speed” cruise control, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)  lets you drive at a preset speed. DRCC uses vehicle-to-vehicle distance control, which adjusts your speed, to help you maintain a preset distance from vehicles ahead of you that are driving at a slower speed. DRCC uses a front-grille-mounted radar and an in-vehicle camera designed to detect vehicles and their distance. If a driver is traveling slower than you, or within your preset range, DRCC will automatically slow your vehicle down without deactivating cruise control. If DRCC determines you need to slow down more, an audio and visual alert notifies you and brakes are applied. When there’s no longer a vehicle driving slower than your set speed in front of you, DRCC will then accelerate and regular cruise control will resume.

2019,Toyota,COROLLA,Standard Toyota Safety Sense™ P (TSS-P),Standard Dynamic Radar Cruise Control,"Intended for highways and similar to “constant speed” cruise control, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)  lets you drive at a preset speed.

DRCC uses a front-grille-mounted radar and an in-vehicle camera designed to detect vehicles and their distance. If a driver is traveling slower than you, or within your preset range, DRCC will automatically slow your vehicle down without deactivating cruise control. If DRCC determines you need to slow down more, an audio and visual alert notifies you and brakes are applied. When there’s no longer a vehicle driving slower than your set speed in front of you, DRCC will then accelerate and regular cruise control will resume.

2019,Toyota,PRIUS,TSS-P,Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection (PCS w/PD),"Pre-Collision System  with Pedestrian Detection  (PCS w/PD) helps keep the road safe by detecting a pedestrian under certain daytime conditions. If the system determines that the possibility of frontal collision with a pedestrian is high, it prompts the driver to take evasive action and brake by using an audio/visual alert. If the driver reacts and brakes, the system may use Brake Assist (BA)  to provide additional brake force. If the driver doesn't react and brake and the system determines that the risk of collision is high, the system may automatically apply the brakes, reducing speed to help mitigate the impact or avoid the collision entirely, if possible.

LDA only activates when you’re traveling at a speed of 32 mph or faster. When you hear and see the alert, after carefully checking the road around you, you should safely direct your vehicle back to the center of your lane. In addition, Prius's Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P)  and Electronic Power Steering (EPS) include Steering Assist (SA)  functionality. When it’s activated and senses that you’re unintentionally drifting, the system may automatically make small corrective steering inputs to help keep your vehicle in its lane.

2019,Toyota,PRIUS,TSS-P,Full-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC),"Intended for highway use and similar to ""constant speed"" cruise control, Full-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)  lets you drive at a preset speed. DRCC uses vehicle-to-vehicle distance control, which is designed to adjust your speed, to help you maintain a preset distance from vehicles ahead of you that are driving at a slower speed. DRCC uses a front-grille-mounted radar and an in-vehicle camera to detect vehicles and their distance. If a driver is traveling slower than you, or within your preset range, DRCC will automatically slow your vehicle down without deactivating cruise control. If DRCC determines you need to slow down more, an audio and visual alert notifies you and brakes are applied. When there's no longer a vehicle driving slower than your preset speed in front of you, DRCC will then accelerate and regular cruise control will resume.

DRCC uses a front-grille-mounted radar and an in-vehicle camera to detect vehicles and their distance. If a driver is traveling slower than you, or within your preset range, DRCC will automatically slow your vehicle down without deactivating cruise control. If DRCC determines you need to slow down more, an audio and visual alert notifies you and brakes are applied. When there’s no longer a vehicle driving slower than your set speed in front of you, DRCC will then accelerate to the preset speed. Select Camry model grades feature Full-Speed Range DRCC,  which is designed to operate between 0-110 mph.

DRCC uses a front-grille-mounted radar and an in-vehicle camera to detect vehicles and their distance. If a driver is traveling slower than you, or within your preset range, DRCC will automatically slow your vehicle down without deactivating cruise control. If DRCC determines you need to slow down more, an audio and visual alert notifies you and brakes are applied. When there’s no longer a vehicle driving slower than your set speed in front of you, DRCC will then accelerate and regular cruise control will resume. Select Camry model grades feature Full-Speed Range DRCC,  which is designed to operate between 0-110 mph.

2019,Toyota,PRIUS PRIME,"Toyota Safety Sense™ (TSS), Designed for Safety.",Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control,"Intended for highways and similar to “constant speed” cruise control, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)  lets you drive at a preset speed. DRCC uses vehicle-to-vehicle distance control, which adjusts your speed, to help you maintain a preset distance from vehicles ahead of you that are driving at a slower speed. DRCC uses a front-grille-mounted radar and an in-vehicle camera to detect vehicles and their distance. If a driver is traveling slower than you, or within your preset range, DRCC will automatically slow your vehicle down without deactivating cruise control. If DRCC determines you need to slow down more, an audio and visual alert notifies you and brakes are applied. When there’s no longer a vehicle driving slower than your set speed in front of you, DRCC will then accelerate and regular cruise control will resume. Prius Prime features Full-Speed Range DRCC,  which is designed to operate between 0-110 mph. However, vehicle speed must be above approximately 28 mph to initiate DRCC. This enables low-speed following, matching speed and, under certain circumstances, stopping before colliding with preceding vehicles on highways.VIEW SPECS",/web/20190209034322im_/https://www.toyota.com/imgix/responsive/images/features/2019/priusprime/DRCC_FEATURE_DETAILS_1956_BY_1000.png?w=870&dpr=1&q=80&fm=jpg&lossless=false&fit=max&cs=strip&bg=fff&auto=compress& 870w

When you hear and see the alert, after carefully checking the road around you, you should safely direct your vehicle back to the center of your lane. In addition, Toyota vehicles equipped with Toyota Safety Sense™ P (TSS-P)  and Electronic Power Steering (EPS) include Steering Assist  functionality. When it’s activated and senses that you’re unintentionally drifting, the system may automatically make small corrective steering inputs to help keep your vehicle in its lane.

If the system determines that a frontal collision is likely, it prompts you to take action using audio and visual alerts. If you notice the potential collision and apply the brakes, PCS w/PD may apply additional force using Brake Assist (BA).  If you don’t brake in time, it may automatically apply the brakes to reduce your speed, helping to minimize the likelihood of a frontal collision or reduce its severity.

LDA only activates when you’re traveling at a speed of 32 mph or faster. When you hear and see the alert, after carefully checking the road around you, you should safely direct your vehicle back to the center of your lane. In addition, Avalon’s Toyota Safety Sense™ P (TSS-P)  and Electronic Power Steering (EPS) include Steering Assist (SA)  functionality. When it’s activated and senses that you’re unintentionally drifting, the system may automatically make small corrective steering inputs to help keep your vehicle in its lane.

2019,Toyota,AVALON,Standard Toyota Safety Sense™ P (TSS-P),Dynamic Radar Cruise Control,"Intended for highways and similar to “constant speed” cruise control, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)  lets you drive at a preset speed. DRCC uses vehicle-to-vehicle distance control, which adjusts your speed, to help you maintain a preset distance from vehicles ahead of you that are driving at a slower speed. DRCC uses a front-grille-mounted radar and an in-vehicle camera designed to detect vehicles and their distance. If a driver is traveling slower than you, or within your preset range, DRCC will automatically slow your vehicle down without deactivating cruise control. If DRCC determines you need to slow down more, an audio and visual alert notifies you and brakes are applied. When there’s no longer a vehicle driving slower than your set speed in front of you, DRCC will then accelerate and regular cruise control will resume. Select Avalon model grades feature Full-Speed Range DRCC,  which is designed to operate between 0-110 mph. This enables low-speed following, matching speed and, under certain circumstances, stopping before colliding with preceding vehicles on highways.

When you hear and see the alert, after carefully checking the road around you, you should safely direct your vehicle back to the center of your lane. In addition, Toyota vehicles equipped with Toyota Safety Sense™ P (TSS-P)  and Electronic Power Steering (EPS) include Steering Assist  functionality. When it’s activated and senses that you’re unintentionally drifting, the system may automatically make small corrective steering inputs to help keep your vehicle in its lane.

2018,Toyota,RAV4,Toyota Safety Sense™ P (TSS-P),Dynamic Radar Cruise Control,"Intended for highways and similar to “constant speed” cruise control, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)  lets you drive at a preset speed. DRCC uses vehicle-to-vehicle distance control, which adjusts your speed, to help you maintain a preset distance from vehicles ahead of you that are driving at a slower speed. DRCC uses a front-grille-mounted radar and an in-vehicle camera designed to detect vehicles and their distance. If a driver is traveling slower than you, or within your preset range, DRCC will automatically slow your vehicle down without deactivating cruise control. If DRCC determines you need to slow down more, an audio and visual alert notifies you and brakes are applied. When there’s no longer a vehicle driving slower than your set speed in front of you, DRCC will then accelerate and regular cruise control will resume.

If the system determines that a frontal collision is likely, it prompts you to take action using audio and visual alerts. If you notice the potential collision and apply the brakes, PCS w/PD may apply additional force using Brake Assist (BA).  If you don’t brake in time, it may automatically apply the brakes to reduce your speed, helping to minimize the likelihood of a frontal collision or reduce its severity.

LDA only activates when you’re traveling at a speed of 32 mph or faster. When you hear and see the alert, after carefully checking the road around you, you should safely direct your vehicle back to the center of your lane. In addition, Toyota vehicles equipped with Toyota Safety Sense™ P (TSS-P)  and Electronic Power Steering (EPS) include Steering Assist  functionality. When it’s activated and senses that you’re unintentionally drifting, the system may automatically make small corrective steering inputs to help keep your vehicle in its lane.

2018,Toyota,RAV4 HYBRID,Toyota Safety Sense™ P (TSS-P),Dynamic Radar Cruise Control,"Intended for highways and similar to “constant speed” cruise control, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)  lets you drive at a preset speed. DRCC uses vehicle-to-vehicle distance control, which adjusts your speed, to help you maintain a preset distance from vehicles ahead of you that are driving at a slower speed. DRCC uses a front-grille-mounted radar and an in-vehicle camera designed to detect vehicles and their distance. If a driver is traveling slower than you, or within your preset range, DRCC will automatically slow your vehicle down without deactivating cruise control. If DRCC determines you need to slow down more, an audio and visual alert notifies you and brakes are applied. When there’s no longer a vehicle driving slower than your set speed in front of you, DRCC will then accelerate and regular cruise control will resume.

If the system determines that a frontal collision is likely, it prompts you to take action using audio and visual alerts. If you notice the potential collision and apply the brakes, PCS w/PD may apply additional force using Brake Assist (BA).  If you don’t brake in time, it may automatically apply the brakes to reduce your speed, helping to minimize the likelihood of a frontal collision or reduce its severity.

By using high beams more frequently, the system may allow earlier detection of pedestrians and obstacles.

When you hear and see the alert, after carefully checking the road around you, you should safely direct your vehicle back to the center of your lane.

2019,Toyota,HIGHLANDER,Toyota Safety Sense™ P (TSS-P),Dynamic Radar Cruise Control,"Intended for highways and similar to “constant speed” cruise control, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)  lets you drive at a preset speed. DRCC uses vehicle-to-vehicle distance control, which adjusts your speed, to help you maintain a preset distance from vehicles ahead of you that are driving at a slower speed. DRCC uses a front-grille-mounted radar and an in-vehicle camera designed to detect vehicles and their distance. If a driver is traveling slower than you, or within your preset range, DRCC will automatically slow your vehicle down without deactivating cruise control. If DRCC determines you need to slow down more, an audio and visual alert notifies you and brakes are applied. When there’s no longer a vehicle driving slower than your set speed in front of you, DRCC will then accelerate to the preset speed.

If the system determines that a frontal collision is likely, it prompts you to take action using audio and visual alerts. If you notice the potential collision and apply the brakes, PCS w/PD may apply additional force using Brake Assist.  If you don’t brake in time, it may automatically apply the brakes to reduce your speed, helping to minimize the likelihood of a frontal collision or reduce its severity.

2018,Toyota,CAMRY HYBRID,Standard Toyota Safety Sense™ P (TSS-P),Dynamic Radar Cruise Control,"Intended for highways and similar to “constant speed” cruise control, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)  lets you drive at a preset speed. DRCC uses vehicle-to-vehicle distance control, which adjusts your speed, to help you maintain a preset distance from vehicles ahead of you that are driving at a slower speed. DRCC uses a front-grille-mounted radar and an in-vehicle camera to detect vehicles and their distance. If a driver is traveling slower than you, or within your preset range, DRCC will automatically slow your vehicle down without deactivating cruise control. If DRCC determines you need to slow down more, an audio and visual alert notifies you and brakes are applied. When there’s no longer a vehicle driving slower than your set speed in front of you, DRCC will then accelerate and regular cruise control will resume. Select Camry model grades feature Full-Speed Range DRCC,  which is designed to operate between 0-110 mph. This enables low-speed following, matching speed and, under certain circumstances, stopping before colliding with preceding vehicles on highways.",/imgix/content/vehicle-landing/2018/camry/features/img/desktop/TMM_FY18_0005_V001.png?w=1500&dpr=1&q=80&fm=jpg&lossless=false&fit=max&cs=strip&bg=fff&

When you hear and see the alert, after carefully checking the road around you, you should safely direct your vehicle back to the center of your lane.

2018,Toyota,RAV4 HYBRID,Toyota Safety Sense™ P (TSS-P),Dynamic Radar Cruise Control,"Intended for highways and similar to “constant speed” cruise control, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)  lets you drive at a preset speed. DRCC uses vehicle-to-vehicle distance control, which adjusts your speed, to help you maintain a preset distance from vehicles ahead of you that are driving at a slower speed. DRCC uses a front-grille-mounted radar and an in-vehicle camera designed to detect vehicles and their distance. If a driver is traveling slower than you, or within your preset range, DRCC will automatically slow your vehicle down without deactivating cruise control. If DRCC determines you need to slow down more, an audio and visual alert notifies you and brakes are applied. When there’s no longer a vehicle driving slower than your set speed in front of you, DRCC will then accelerate and regular cruise control will resume.

If the system determines that a frontal collision is likely, it prompts you to take action using audio and visual alerts. If you notice the potential collision and apply the brakes, PCS w/PD may apply additional force using Brake Assist (BA).  If you don’t brake in time, it may automatically apply the brakes to reduce your speed, helping to minimize the likelihood of a frontal collision or reduce its severity.

2019,Toyota,PRIUS PRIME,"Toyota Safety Sense™ (TSS), Designed for Safety.",Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control,"Intended for highways and similar to “constant speed” cruise control, Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)  lets you drive at a preset speed. DRCC uses vehicle-to-vehicle distance control, which adjusts your speed, to help you maintain a preset distance from vehicles ahead of you that are driving at a slower speed. DRCC uses a front-grille-mounted radar and an in-vehicle camera to detect vehicles and their distance. If a driver is traveling slower than you, or within your preset range, DRCC will automatically slow your vehicle down without deactivating cruise control. If DRCC determines you need to slow down more, an audio and visual alert notifies you and brakes are applied. When there’s no longer a vehicle driving slower than your set speed in front of you, DRCC will then accelerate and regular cruise control will resume. Prius Prime features Full-Speed Range DRCC,  which is designed to operate between 0-110 mph. However, vehicle speed must be above approximately 28 mph to initiate DRCC. This enables low-speed following, matching speed and, under certain circumstances, stopping before colliding with preceding vehicles on highways.VIEW SPECS",/web/20190209034322im_/https://www.toyota.com/imgix/responsive/images/features/2019/priusprime/DRCC_FEATURE_DETAILS_1956_BY_1000.png?w=870&dpr=1&q=80&fm=jpg&lossless=false&fit=max&cs=strip&bg=fff&auto=compress& 870w

When you hear and see the alert, after carefully checking the road around you, you should safely direct your vehicle back to the center of your lane. In addition, Toyota vehicles equipped with Toyota Safety Sense™ P (TSS-P)  and Electronic Power Steering (EPS) include Steering Assist  functionality. When it’s activated and senses that you’re unintentionally drifting, the system may automatically make small corrective steering inputs to help keep your vehicle in its lane.

DRCC uses a front-grille-mounted radar and an in-vehicle camera to detect vehicles and their distance. If a driver is traveling slower than you, or within your preset range, DRCC will automatically slow your vehicle down without deactivating cruise control. If DRCC determines you need to slow down more, an audio and visual alert notifies you and brakes are applied. When there's no longer a vehicle driving slower than your preset speed in front of you, DRCC will then accelerate and regular cruise control will resume.

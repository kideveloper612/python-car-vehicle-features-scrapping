 is the toughest, hardest-working generation of Class 3-5 chassis cab we’ve ever built.

Plus, we built the fully boxed under-cab and C-channel aft-of-cab frame of 95% high-strength steel. That means hauling and towing capability you can depend on to deliver every workday.",https://www.ford.com//ford-h.assetsadobe.com/is/image/content/dam/vdm_ford/live/en_us/ford/nameplate/chassiscab/2020/collections/dm/20_FRD_FSD_45446.tif?croppathe=1_21x9&wid=1440

2019,Ford,F-650-750,PRODUCTIVITY,BUILT TO WORK HARD. DESIGNED TO HELP MAKE YOUR JOB EASY.,"In addition to working hard, Ford F-650 and F-750 trucks work smart. The work-ready frame is designed to easily accommodate vocational bodies. The Power Stroke® V8 Turbo Diesel engine monitors the diesel particulate filter (DPF) and initiates DPF regeneration when needed. And then there’s the Intelligent Oil-Life Monitor® on the diesel engine that alerts you when it needs an oil change based on actual vehicle usage. Brawn meets brains in Ford Medium Duty trucks.",https://www.ford.com/cmslibs/content/dam/vdm_ford/live/en_us/ford/nameplate/f-650-750/2019/collections/features/3-2/18_FRD_CMD_100022_MDF750Aerial_21_9.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1440.1440.jpeg

2019,Ford,F-650-750,PRODUCTIVITY,ACTIVE REGEN CONTROL,"When exhaust soot builds up in the diesel particulate filter (DPF), the engine will need to clear the filter of soot through a process called active regeneration. The Power Stroke®
 diesel offers an Active Regen Control that delays this auto regeneration if the truck is idling over combustible material such as dry grass. When idling, especially for extended periods of time, the engine doesn’t generate enough heat to automatically clear the DPF. That’s when the standard Manual Regen initiation feature comes in. A light on the instrument panel alerts the driver of the need for regeneration, and pushing a button starts the process.",https://www.ford.com/cmslibs/content/dam/vdm_ford/live/en_us/ford/nameplate/f-650-750/2019/collections/features/3-2/C7408017_COMF_750_DrvrProfDumpTruckAtSite_mn_21_9.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1440.1440.jpeg
